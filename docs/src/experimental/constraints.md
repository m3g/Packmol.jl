# Constraints

!!! warning "Experimental"
    This documents the native Julia packing engine's constraint syntax,
    shared between [input files](input_files.md) and the
    [Julia API](julia_api.md). It tracks the original Fortran
    [Packmol](http://github.com/m3g/packmol) keywords where they exist, but
    is not yet a complete port — see [Home](index.md) for what's covered so
    far.

A constraint restricts where the atoms of a structure are allowed to be. In
an input file, each one is declared as a line inside a
`structure ... end structure` block, and takes the form:

```
<placement> <shape> <parameters...>
```

Multiple constraints can be given for the same structure — a molecule must
then satisfy all of them simultaneously (e.g. `inside box ...` together with
`outside sphere ...` carves a box with a spherical hole in it). By default a
constraint applies to every atom of the structure; in an input file, wrapping
a subset of lines in an `atoms <indices> ... end` block restricts a
constraint to just those atoms (see [Structure blocks](input_files.md) in
Input files).

## Box

```
inside box  xmin ymin zmin  xmax ymax zmax
outside box xmin ymin zmin  xmax ymax zmax
```

An axis-aligned rectangular box spanning the given corners.

## Cube

```
inside cube  x y z  side
outside cube x y z  side
```

An axis-aligned cube of the given `side` length, with `(x,y,z)` as its
lower corner (matching Fortran Packmol; note this differs from `box`, whose
first three numbers are also a corner but combined with a second corner
rather than a side length).

## Sphere

```
inside sphere  x y z  radius
outside sphere x y z  radius
```

A sphere of the given `radius` centered at `(x,y,z)`.

## Plane

```
above plane x y z d
over plane  x y z d
below plane x y z d
```

A half-space cut by the plane `x*a + y*b + z*c = d`, where `(a,b,c)` is the
plane's normal vector (the first three numbers) and `d` is given as the
fourth. `above`/`over` are synonyms (both accepted by the original Fortran
Packmol); `below` is the complementary half-space.

## Cylinder

```
inside cylinder  cx cy cz  vx vy vz  radius length
outside cylinder cx cy cz  vx vy vz  radius length
```

A finite, capped cylinder: `(cx,cy,cz)` is the center of one end cap,
`(vx,vy,vz)` is the axis direction (any nonzero vector — it does not need to
be normalized), `radius` is the cylinder's radius, and `length` is how far
the cylinder extends from the given end, along the axis, to the other cap.

## Ellipsoid

```
inside ellipsoid  cx cy cz  a b c  scale
outside ellipsoid cx cy cz  a b c  scale
```

An axis-aligned ellipsoid centered at `(cx,cy,cz)` with semi-axes `a`, `b`,
`c` along x, y, z respectively, uniformly scaled by the dimensionless
`scale` factor — i.e. the effective semi-axes are `a*scale`, `b*scale`,
`c*scale`. `scale` lets the same base ellipsoid (e.g. one fit to a
reference structure) be grown or shrunk without recomputing `a`, `b`, `c`.

## Julia constructors

Each shape above also has `Inside`/`Outside` (or `Above`/`Below`) Julia
constructors with the same parameters, for building a `PackmolSystem`
[directly from Julia code](julia_api.md) instead of a text file: `InsideBox`,
`OutsideBox`, `InsideCube`, `OutsideCube`, `InsideSphere`, `OutsideSphere`,
`InsideCylinder`, `OutsideCylinder`, `InsideEllipsoid`, `OutsideEllipsoid`,
`AbovePlane`, `BelowPlane`. Each also accepts an optional `weight` keyword
(the constraint penalty's weight in the objective function).
