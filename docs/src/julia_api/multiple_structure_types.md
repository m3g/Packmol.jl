# Multiple structure types

Pass one `structure_type` per kind of molecule; each gets its own
constraints:

```julia
solute = structure_type("solute.pdb"; number=1, fixed=([0.,0.,0.],[0.,0.,0.]))
water = structure_type(
    "water.pdb";
    number = 1000,
    constraints = [OutsideSphere([0.,0.,0.],15.), InsideBox([-30.,-30.,-30.],[30.,30.,30.])],
)

sys = PackmolSystem([solute, water]; output = "solvated.pdb", tolerance = 2.0)
packmol(sys)
```
